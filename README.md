# unit-4-game
Read me file for Unit 4 game:
Please see the photo in my images folder titled proj4-screenshot. This photo shows the project I thought I was turning in. After submitting the project, I decided to pull the code up in an incognito window to confirm that it looked good. I was very disappointed to see that the image in the incognito window was styled differently.

I created variables for the stones, wins, losses, target number and a variable to track the players score.
The game starts upon being opened in the browser. Prior to play, the variables are all initiated, the target number the player will try to match is established and the crystals have all been assigned a whole-number, random value between 1 and 19.

Each time the player clicks on a crystal; the value of the crystal is added to their sum. Once their sum matches or exceeds the target amount, the round is over.

If the player exceeds the target amount, they lose the round and their number of losses increases by +1.

If a player matches the target number, they win the rounds and their number of wins increase by +1.

If I had more time to work on this project, I’d improve the messaging to the user. Currently there is text that is visible when the player loses but no text when they win. This text currently appears very small and insignificant.  

In addition to player messaging and improving the aesthetic appearance of the game, I’d also work on having a pause between rounds. Currently the game keeps playing as long as the player keeps clicking. When the player wins or loses, the event is properly tallied but with the next click the game immediately flows into the next round.

I felt very good about this project. I felt this was the first project where I really owed the code. I felt good about the improvement I’ve made in variable-naming, writing pseudo-code and basic code organization.

Throughout the project I worked hard to put a lot of thought into my functions with the goal of giving each function one job.
